                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

                    <p>Client-side rendering or CSR is a different approach to how the web page is processed for display in the browser. In the CSR, the burden of compiling dynamic content and generating HTML for them is transferred to the client's browser.</p>
                    <p>The normal flow of web page rendering for a client-side rendering scenario follows these steps:
                    </p>

        
                   <li></li>The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser).
                   <li></li>Instead of a server, a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be used to serve static HTML, CSS, and supporting files to the user.
                   <li></li>The browser downloads the HTML and then the JS. Meanwhile, the user sees a loading symbol.
                   <li></li>After the browser fetches the JS, it makes API requests via AJAX to fetch the dynamic content and processes it to render the final content.
                   <li>After the server responds, the final content is rendered using DOM processing in the client's browser.

                    <p>Server-side rendering or SSR is the conventional way of rendering web pages on the browser.</p> 
                    <p>The traditional way of rendering dynamic web content follows the below steps:</p>

                    <li></li>The user sends a request to a website (usually via a browser)
                    <li></li>The server checks the resource, compiles and prepares the HTML content after traversing through server-side scripts lying within the page.
                    <li></li>This compiled HTML is sent to the clientâ€™s browser for further rendering and display.
                    <li></li>The browser downloads the HTML and makes the site visible to the end-user
                    <li></li>The browser then downloads the Javascript (JS) and as it executes the JS, it makes the page interactive
